# Worms Game with Pygame

Welcome to the Worms Game, a classic turn-based strategy game implemented in Python using Pygame. This project features map generation using Lagrange formulas, realistic movement calculations for worms, wind simulation with speed and direction, and mathematical formulas for different projectile movements, including straight-line shooting, parabolic shots, and rebound for certain projectiles.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Install Pygame using the following command:
    ```bash
    pip install pygame
    ```

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/worms-game.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd worms-game
    ```

3. Run the game:
    ```bash
    python game.py
    ```

## Game Features

### Map Generation

The game features a map generated using Lagrange formulas.

### Worms Movement

Worms move realistically using velocity calculations.

### Wind Simulation

Experience realistic wind simulation with varying speed and direction, affecting the trajectory of projectiles.

### Projectile Types

The game includes four types of projectiles, each with its specific mathematical formula for movement:

1. **Straight-Line Shooting:** Projectile moves in a straight line from the shooter to the target.
2. **Parabolic Shots:** Projectile follows a parabolic trajectory, influenced by gravity.
3. **Rebound Shots:** Certain projectiles can rebound off surfaces, adding an extra layer of strategy.

## Controls

-   Use the QZSD keys to navigate and aim.
-   Press the corresponding number keys (1-4) to select a weapon, and left-click to shoot.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to add more features, levels, or customize the gameplay to your liking. Have fun playing the Worms Game!
